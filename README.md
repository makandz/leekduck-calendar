# Leekduck Calendar

LeekDuck is my go-to source for Pokémon GO event information, but it does not offer a calendar style view. This project fills that gap.

Leekduck Calendar is a simple web app that displays Pokémon GO events in a monthly calendar format. You can browse between months and click on any event to view its full details on LeekDuck.

This project focuses on readability and quick at-a-glance planning rather than replacing LeekDuck itself.
